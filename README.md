# ThreadChannelsProgram-
Application is designed as a multi-threaded C program that processes numerical data from various input channels, combining them into a single output after applying optional signal processing techniques. It reads from multiple files, each representing a channel with sequences of 16-bit integers, and performs low-pass filtering and amplification.
